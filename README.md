# Unity Environment for Catheter Simulation  

This repository contains the code for building a **Unity Environment** to simulate a catheter navigating a flexible aorta. This work is part of the study described in **[this IEEE publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659217).**  

## Training the Catheter  
The catheter can be trained following the instructions provided in **[Unity ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).**  

## Repository Structure  
- **`Assets/`** â€“ Contains the Unity environment, different actors, and related scripts.  
- **`Demonstration/`** â€“ Includes a set of recorded demonstrations for training the agent, which can be used as-is or extended.  
- **`config/`** â€“ Contains `.yaml` files for the different network configurations tested.  

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs. ðŸš€
